ABOUT
=====

This module at the moment just simply adds a close button to the notifications
that show up in the admin section, so they can be closed easily.

It doesn't show up for things like the re-index notice, which is actually 
triggered from the Index module, not from the AdminNotifications module, and
should probably be dealt with by a merchant and not simply closed.


INSTALL
=======

1. You need to have jQuery installed and loaded in your admin.
1.1. I had to do this manually as the Mxperts_Jquery module didn't seem to 
     support jQuery in the admin.

2. For OSX / Linux users:
2.1. cd into dev/shell/ and run install.sh

For PC users
============
What's the matter with you, get a Mac already.


TODO
====
1. If there are additional unread notifications available after the latest one is
closed, load them up after the latest one is closed.
2. Implement jQuery loading.
